My true size should have been a 2X, but because I have really broad shoulders a 2X jacket would not fit. So I had to go up to a 3X. The was too large, the only thing that fit perfectly was the best that came with the suit. My seamstress altered the jacket and the pants to fit me. Now the suit fit me perfect. The alterations cost the same amount as the suit.\n\nI know this is easier said than done but it should be an option where you can mix and match maybe a 2X pant with a 3X jacket so maybe you don't have to alterate the whole entire suit just one piece to make it fit.",

Eliminated the need for a belt, he kept the jacket on the entire night so no one could ever tell that he was missing a belt. Certain that a belt would hide the fact that the waistline is flexible.\n\nVest is great for wearing more casual with dress shirt and jeans. Will likely wear more than any other part of the suit.\n\nDid take to the cleaners on the day it arrived for one pressing to get the folded wrinkles out.\n\nWell worth the price and convenience.\n\nVery pleased overall!",
