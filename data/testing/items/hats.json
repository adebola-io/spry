I'm used to wearing new era fitted caps and this is definitely lighter. The cotton fabric is on the thinner side but it looks and feels like it will hold up. The hat looks great with its two tone color scheme, all black and green on the underside of the bill. The bill feels firm yet flexible similar to a new era baseball fitted. So my only issue with this cap is the fact that it's on the taller side. I wear a 7 1/4 fitted and the dome on this thing is definitely on the taller side. I'm not exactly swimming in the hat, but I'd say its a relaxed fit and there is a lot of empty space at the top of the cap. There is a slight gap on the sides as well but I'm sure that will change as I break the cap in. I plan on running this thru the washer and dryer to see if I can get the cap to shrink a bit. Will update if anything changes.",

This hat is perfect for that because it's the correct color and it doesn't have a cutout on the back. It's pretty difficult to find a red hat nowadays (because, y'know) so I was glad to find one that matches the meme perfectly. It fits well so it doesn't ride up with my hair. Doesn't seem like it will move around too much. It also feels thick and well made. The bill is a bit flatter than I expected, but it does look like that in the picture so that one's on me. It still works great though and I'm happy!",

Then, on my husband who typically does have to get larger sized hats (US size 7 5/8), this one will not even remotely fit.\nThis is very disappointing, because I initially ordered this so my husband could wear it, but it doesnâ€™t fit. Itâ€™s not just the fact that itâ€™s tight around the head but also the cap is rather shallow. Iâ€™m not sure if I somehow received a youth size, but this hat fits my five-year-old son pretty well (heâ€™s got a slightly larger than average head for his age). I love the look of this hat, and itâ€™s very nicely made. I just wish it fit better.",
