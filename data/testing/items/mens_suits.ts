My true size should have been a 2X, but because I have really broad shoulders a 2X jacket would not fit. So I had to go up to a 3X. The was too large, the only thing that fit perfectly was the best that came with the suit. My seamstress altered the jacket and the pants to fit me. Now the suit fit me perfect. The alterations cost the same amount as the suit.

I know this is easier said than done but it should be an option where you can mix and match maybe a 2X pant with a 3X jacket so maybe you don't have to alterate the whole entire suit just one piece to make it fit.`,

            content: `Son agreed to go to homecoming at last minute and no time for shopping for suits in stores.

Clearly not tailored but jacket easily could be for a custom fit.

Great value for growing teen as he likely will be too big for this in a year from now.

Son is 5'10 and 167 lbs in this size large.

Waist has hidden stretch and was needed for him. Eliminated the need for a belt, he kept the jacket on the entire night so no one could ever tell that he was missing a belt. Certain that a belt would hide the fact that the waistline is flexible.

Vest is great for wearing more casual with dress shirt and jeans. Will likely wear more than any other part of the suit.

Did take to the cleaners on the day it arrived for one pressing to get the folded wrinkles out.

Well worth the price and convenience.

Very pleased overall!`,
