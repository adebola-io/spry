I was afraid I was going to have the break the zipper to get out of the jacket, luckily I didn't but I wore it unzipped for the rest of the walk.\n\nOverall it's fine for what I need, I'd suggest maybe going up a size or two to avoid the zipper issue",

Has a draw string around the waist to help shape. Has buttons and a zipper. Im able to zip with ease, not to tight in any given place. It fits me perfectly, but I definitely won't be able to throw it over a hoody, as some people were mentioning. I have wide shoulders and it fits comfortably, but there is no extra room there. The rest is pretty spacey in a good way. So if you want to wear a hoody under this jacket, size up. I'm used to a cool, wet climate, so a lighter waterproof, fleece lined jacket works perfect for me. I needed something for daily errands and running the kids to and from school and this jacket hit every need for me. 10/10 recommend. It's my new favorite jacket.",

This is not a rain coat: I don’t feel it would repel water well at all, but for a formal night out, it’s a nice dressy coat. I wore it in 42 degree weather and it was fine altho I was only outside in it for about 30 minutes. The fit was nice with a good amount of stretch, the sleeves were the perfect length (often too short on me as I have long arms for my height), the bottom length hit me at about mid shin but I am short (5’2” 135) but with the flared style and a 3.5 heel, the look was very flattering, a little 50’s retro almost, but in a good way. There was a little bit of excess lining material on the inside, but it didn’t hang below the hem, so that’s ok. I did have to give it a really good all-over steaming out of the package as it was really wrinkled: I would Not recommend ironing: I feel this material would melt or darken where the hot iron hits it, and directions say not to put in the dryer. And you can’t beat the low price. Overall, I was very satisfied and would recommend.",

I was a little nervous about the shoulder width before I got it because of the measurements they give, thinking maybe I should have bought a large. The medium actually fits perfect and I usually buy a large jacket. It was warm enough for me in 30 degree weather with a thin sweater underneath, but I didn't stay outside for a long period of time. Love that it has pockets too!\nI wouldn't say the material stretches, so read the reviews to help you pick the correct size. I'm a little curvier and I love the fit!! The only negative I would mention is there is only one belt loop in the back of the coat. So if it is unbuttoned and the belt is not tied, I had to tuck the belt ends in the pockets so it wouldn't drag behind me. Besides that one negative, I would definitely recommend it!!",

I wish there were one at each side of the waist sides. Also the sleeve length is a little short, so if you have long arms, this may not work well for you. Last, when you tie the belt around your waist, the space between buttons and your chest (like me, having a larger chest) is not much surface area so you have to hike the belt up high. Lastly, the side pockets in the folds are hard to find when you're out & about. It takes a moment. Overall though, it looks amazing on, accentuates your waist and is very flattering and pretty warm too!!! I wore it on the single digit cold Christmas Chicago day and it kept me warm!

I've only been wearing it for a few days, but I've already gotten a ton of compliments. I got the baby blue color and it's really pretty in person. The material is decent, the buttons seem to be sewn on well, and the pockets, though hard to find sometimes, are a good size. I definitely do not regret my purchase. Though, I do recommend, if you have a larger chest, order a size up because the buttons close right underneath the bust line and it can be tight, especially after a large meal. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, like others have mentioned, there's only 1 loop for the belt and it's in the back, so you have to keep the belt tied otherwise it will drag on the ground (unless you're a tall person).",
